          Soma is a unique concept in the Vedas addressed with many variations.
          As we have discussed in the beginning, the Vedic concepts used by
          Rishis are of 3 categories, the material, the divine, and the Yogic
          plane (adhibhautika, adhidaivika, and adhibhautika). Hence Soma is a
          Deva and a king, the same Soma is the home of ṛta RV1.43, Soma is also
          the juice of a plant used in Yagna as a substitute for Amṛta. The Soma
          herb as explained in Atharva Veda is the foremost and pure AV11.6.15
          and is the divine energy of all flora/vegetation AV5.24.7,GS1.16. At
          times, Soma is the celestial Moon described in Atharva Veda 10 &
          11.6.9 which says “Soma; whom the learned men call Chandrama the Moon
          making all delight” and “The Supreme Being keeps making Soma, the
          eternal delight” which is empirical to amṛta dripping from the
          crescent moon on Śiva’s head, but before we make this conclusion let’s
          explore further.
          <img

            width="100"

          />
          Sometimes, Soma is the full moon belonging to the Tiṣya/Pusya month,
          on this day oblations are given to Rudra. Monday is called Somavara
          and is the day of Śiva TS2.2.10. Kausitaki Brāhmaṇa 6 makes it very
          clear when it says “Rudra is Chandrama” which matches with Śatapatha
          Brahmāṇa of Śukla Yajur Veda 6.3 wherein the Mahadeva expansion of
          Rudra is Chandrama/moon. Similar to Rudra, the concept of Soma enters
          into various aspects of the Yajñá (Yagna). In this way, Soma enters
          into the offering of the Soma:latha juice, into clarified butter
          (ghee) used in Yagna, or the full moon, into medicines, into amṛta,
          and is the very ṛta. In other places, Somapavamana, meaning the
          purified/clarified/refined version of Soma, gave rise to both Indra
          and Viṣṇu during Yajñá RV9.96.5. This does not mean Viṣṇu takes
          physical birth because various divine concepts (Devas) emerge during
          various states of Yajñá performed by Prajāpati. Soma is also addressed
          as an additive to milk or ghee used as Medha (offering) of Yajñá. Soma
          is also used as a synonym for amṛta and it is this Soma that the Devas
          compete RV1.108, Indra more than others, as his strength comes from
          the divine Soma through which He and other Devas conquered all the
          worlds RV8.92/9.62.29. It is this Soma that gives them health,
          immortality, and strength to fight off Vṛtra, allowing room for ṛta.
          To this, the Maruts provide their support. Many dualities are paired
          among various divine concepts in the Vedas, like Mitra-Varuna,
          similarly, Rudra and Soma are paired together as a dual divinity
          across Vedas and are treated as one. Atharva Veda also pairs Bhava and
          Rudra as dual divinity AV11.2.15, similarly, all 8 aspects of Rudras
          become one concept.

            bestow us (वर्ध) into the trance of fragrance (सुगंधिं) | May you
            untie our bonds (बंधना) like a ripened gourd fruit (उर्वारु) unties
            itself from the stem, and take us beyond death (मृत्यु) and deplete

            immortal state (अ॒मृत॑) (मृत्यु + मोक्ष (मोह+क्षेय) + मा-अमृतात्)
            Please note: सुगंधिं does not mean physical perfume, but the
            nostalgia one feels upon experiencing a certain sound or fragrance
            or taste. So it means to bestow us into the sweetness of imagining
            Thy Divinity during the transcendental states of dhyana/dharana.
            र्क्षीय: means to deplete, and र्मुक्षीय means to deplete our
            moha/compulsions arising out of Avidya. मा is also an Adj & Conj use
            as negative as “not”.
