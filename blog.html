            <h3>Rudra / Śhiva's Viṣvarūpam: Macro Appearance of Rudra</h3>
            <p>Ṛṣis of the Vedas were very explicit about the appearance of Rudra and the commonality with that of
                Puranic Śiva. While the first declaration to Rudra is seen in the Rig Veda, the Saṃhitās of Atharva &
                Yajur Vedas gave utmost detail to His features and nature, but the important aspect is the usage of
                terminology and the consistency across Vedas is impressive. Let’s see why the Vedic Ṛṣis addressed Rudra
                as Viṣvarūpam starting with his color/hue, hair, eyes, throat, count of Rudra, and more.

                Let’s go over various shades/colors used to describe Rudra and find out how Rudra can have such
                diversity. Rig Veda says: “He is brilliant shines like the Sun, dazzling like gold, and the best of the
                divine and of Vasu”RV1.43.5, so the keyword here is “brilliance/ shine“. Now, let us compare this with
                Yajur Veda, Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4.5.5 which says: “Oh lord of mountains, whose brilliance/rays which
                permeates”, the Sanskrit word here is Hiraṇya (हिरण्य) meaning the Golden/brilliant one. Let’s compare
                the above with titles from three different Vedic Śākhās, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 16.11, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
                10.22.40 & Caraka-Katha Āraṇyaka:</p>
